The hook drivers only load scripts that are in /etc/hooks, have
their x bit set and have a name ending in .hook.

LI* hooks are run on login, and LO* hooks are run on logout.

You'll probably want to replace hook_background.jpg with something
appropriate for your local environment.

You need to download a copy of iHook from 

http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/ihook/ 

since my hook driver scripts rely on it to present a pretty dialog
with a progress bar during login & logout as they run the appropriate
hook scripts.

Tar it up, then bzip2 the tarball. I recommend keeping the tarball
(with version number in the name) on a central server, then letting
make download it and rename it to iHook.app.tar.bz2 as part of the
package build process. This will let you reproduce specific versions
of the package later.
