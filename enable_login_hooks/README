The hook drivers only load scripts that are in /etc/hooks, have
their x bit set, and have either an LI or LO prefix in their name.
They're run in alphabetic order.

LI* hooks are run on login, and LO* hooks are run on logout.

You'll probably want to replace hook_background.jpg with something
appropriate for your local environment.

Prerequisites:

iHook - You need to download a copy of iHook from

http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/ihook/

since the hook driver scripts rely on it to present a pretty dialog
with a progress bar during login & logout as they run the appropriate
hook scripts.

Tar it up, then bzip2 the tarball. I recommend keeping the tarball
(with version number in the name) on a central server, then letting
make download it and rename it to iHook.app.tar.bz2 as part of the
package build process. This will let you reproduce specific versions
of the package later.

Luggage isn't necessary to run the hook loaders, just to make
deploying them to your Macintoshes easier. You need to update
TARBALL_LOCATION in the included Luggage Makefile to point to where
you're storing your iHook tarball, then you can make a dmg with a
pkg file containing everything necessary for the hook script suite
with 'make dmg'. That dmg can then be easily deployed with InstaDMG
or puppet.
